          I always have my camera (a Fuji XT4) on me.
          I really enjoy shooting architecture and short lenses. If you want to nerd out about photography, I'm the right guy. <br/>
          Beyond, I'm currently training for a 90 km bike race late this year. During training (and in general) I listen to podcasts a lot.
          I really can recommend Darknet Diaries. Give it a try, you won't regret it.
