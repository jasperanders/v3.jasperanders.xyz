I created the website for an association I was part of. For this, I used [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com), a static site generator based on React. One feature made it especially appealing to me: Gatsby uses GraphQL to query static files - specifically Markdown. This allowed me to set up GitHub as a CMS. Adding or editing blog entries or other content is as easy as creating or editing a Markdown file. Everything can be done on the GitHub website, nobody needed to install any tools. The repo is connected to [render.com](https://render.com), a platform similar to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or [Netlify](https://netlify.com), allowing for instant deployment of changes.

For us, this hit the perfect middle ground between me having to make all the changes and having to deal with the overhead of an actual CMS. Further, using GitHub as an interface, we didn't have to deal with user authentication.
